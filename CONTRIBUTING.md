# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth collaboration.

## Branching Strategy
- Create a new branch for each syntax highlighting or color design change.
  - Branch names should be clear and descriptive, focusing on the aspect of the theme you're modifying.
  - Use lowercase with hyphens for improved readability (e.g., `syntax-highlighting-update`, `color-design-tweaks`).
- Changes related to syntax highlighting and color design should be made and committed within the respective branch.
- Pull requests should be opened from your color-related branch to the main development branch.
- Reference any relevant issues in your pull request.

## Issues
- Look for issues labeled "code syntax" to find areas where help is needed.
- Open a new issue if you discover a bug or have a feature request.
